Interested in using this in your own program with an _**API**?_ ðŸ˜² Try [/left](https://tarkov-time.adam.id.au/left), [/right](https://tarkov-time.adam.id.au/right), and [/api](https://tarkov-time.adam.id.au/api)! Incredible! You can also use [/api?type=plain](https://tarkov-time.adam.id.au/api?type=plain) to get the time in plaintext format.

Or, better yet, use the the 30 lines of logic at [src/time.ts](src/time.ts) instead :)

## Windows program

Want a very minimal desktop application that shows the two times? You're in luck: head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/adamburgess/tarkov-time/releases) page to download a small rust program that does just that.
